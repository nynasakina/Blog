# Blog
I first learned about HTML and CSS when I discovered blogging when I was 13 years old. This is my attempt to recreate one of the websites I spent most of my time on when I was blogging ; Blogger.com. 

Built on **ReactJS** and styled with **CSS**, this project is currently still a work in progress. Next is to add back end so that the following features can be added:
<ul>
  <li>User Register/ Log in/ Log Out</li>
  <li>User creates, updates, edits or deletes a post</li>
    </ul>
